# Tug of War for Arduino
> Tug of War is a game where two players pull on a rope, one player winning by pulling the rope far enough to their own side. In this version, the two players press a button as fast as they can to pull the virtual rope to their side.

Written for an Arduino for *Gadgets*, a class at Carnegie Mellon University, taught by Scott Hudson.
